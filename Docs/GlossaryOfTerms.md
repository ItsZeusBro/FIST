# Glossary


## File Interactions
#### Quantality
This is a special word we use for describing the abstract quantity context and rules associated with some concrete attempt to move a specific number of bits.

#### Positionality
This is a special word we use for describing the abstract position context and rules associated with some concrete attempt to move bits from a potential position in a file.


#### Clusivity
This is a special word we use for describing the abstract clusive context and rules associated with some concrete attempt to describe the orientation of data ownership after the flow of data has occured.

## Sexy Transactions

#### Flow
This is a complex one time transaction between files, that is described by the Quantality, Positionality, and Clusivity of the flow.

#### Script


#### Stream
This is a complex stream transaction between files, that is described by the Quantality, Positionality, and Clusivity of the stream.


## Shorthands
#### tality
Short hand for quantality. Usually is something that initializes a Quan class, like this: Quan(tality). Tality here is a valid object describing a Quantity of data that we are flowing or streaming to some file.

#### ality
Short hand for Positionality. Usually is something that initializes a Position class, like this: Position(ality). Ality in this case is a valid object describing a Position from which we read from or write to.

#### ivity
Short hand for Clusivity. Usually is something that initializes a Clus class, like this: Clus(ivity). Ivity in this case is a valid object describing the Clusive orientation of the File Interaction. (sharing properties like "inclusive" or "exclusive")

#### alityf
This is the "ality from" position associated with the source file and bit position from which data flows or streams.

#### alityt
This is the "ality to" position associated with the destination file and bit position to which data flows or streams.

## Longhands
#### sPosaQuanaClus
This is a string that could be a Positionality, Quantality, or Clusivity, in cases where a general class handles all three for general tasks.

## Corruptions

#### Sanatiz
This is a corruption of the english word "Sanatizer". We like Sanatiz better. 

#### Sclusatiz
Sclusatiz is the Sanatiz'r of a would be Clusivity string

#### Squanatiz
Squanatiz is the Sanatiz'r of a would be Quantality string

#### Sposatiz
Sposatiz is the Sanatiz'r of a would be Positonality string


## Analogies
#### Model
This represents all the code in Source that has to do with low level file operations.

#### View
This represents all the code having to do with validating input from the user functions, and returning output to the user. Validated input is to be consumed by the Controller functions.

#### Controller
This represents the business logic middleware between the Model and View.

## Bug Classes
#### June Bug 
A type of bug that should only exist in limited contexts

#### No-See-Ums
A type of bug we don't often see, but we know still exists

#### Water Bugs 
A memory leak bug

#### Praying Mantis
Bugs we only see at scale

## Miscilaneous
#### Comet
This is a tool i'm working on to create a better debugging experience, and logs for Ai optimization and debugging. 

#### Goody Bag
This is an unordered bag of miscellaneous tools

#### Magic Spells
These are regex strings that are so long and well known, we call them Magic Spells
