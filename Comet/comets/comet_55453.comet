                which means it is only a single value that represents where from
                the start of positionality one wants to extend in the amount of data sent
             Quantality represents the amount of data flowing from file a to file b FistView.quan(tality) ACCEPTS end, mid, percentages (strings), +-*/ ops 
 Example: 1b, 2mb, 14gb, 0.5, 1b, 5%
